## ✨ Example Responses

### Query: "Difference between QuickSort and BubbleSort?"
```
### QuickSort vs Bubble Sort

| Feature | Quick Sort | Bubble Sort |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Algorithm | Divide & Conquer | Comparison-based |
| Best Time | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Average Time | O(n log n) | O(n²) |
| Worst Time | O(n²) | O(n²) |
| Space | O(log n) | O(1) |

When to use Quick Sort:
- Large datasets
- Performance critical
- General purpose

When to use Bubble Sort:
- Educational
- Nearly sorted data
```

### Query: "Explain DFS"
```
### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Space Complexity: O(V)

Use Cases:
✓ Topological sorting
✓ Cycle detection
✓ Maze solving
```

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO
- ✅ Be specific: "Explain QuickSort"
- ✅ Use standard names: "DFS" or "BFS"
- ✅ Ask comparisons: "Difference between X and Y"
- ✅ Ask about complexity: "Time complexity of..."
- ✅ Ask for use cases: "When to use binary search?"

### ❌ DON'T
- ❌ Be too vague: "Tell me about algorithms"
- ❌ Use slang: "Fast sorting"
- ❌ Ask for code: "Write quicksort for me"
- ❌ Ask about unrelated topics

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Getting Welcome Message
**Solution:** Try a more specific query with algorithm names

### Issue: Want More Detailed Responses
**Solution:** Add your Gemini API key to `.env`

### Issue: Algorithm Not Recognized
**Solution:** Check if it's in the supported list in DSA_RESPONSE_GUIDE.md

---

## 📊 What's Supported

### ✅ Fully Supported
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort
- Binary Search, Linear Search
- DFS, BFS, Dijkstra
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Hash Maps
- Time/Space Complexity
- Algorithm Comparisons

### 🔄 Partially Supported

## 💡 Smart Features

### Case-Insensitive
```
"QuickSort" = "quicksort" = "quick sort" = "QUICK SORT"
```

### Pattern Recognition
```
"Difference between X and Y" → Comparison table
"Explain X" → Detailed explanation
"Time complexity of X" → Complexity analysis
```

### Smart Fallback
```
If query doesn't match → Shows helpful suggestions
Instead of: "I don't understand"
Shows: "Try asking about: QuickSort, DFS, etc."
```
