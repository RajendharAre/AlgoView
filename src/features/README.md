# Features Directory

This directory contains feature-specific modules that may be developed in the future.

## Structure

- Authentication (`auth/`)
- Algorithms (`algorithms/`)
- Interview Preparation (`interview/`)
- User Profile (`profile/`)

## Purpose

Each feature directory will contain:
- Feature-specific components
- Redux slices (if needed)
- Hooks
- Utilities
- Tests

## Current Status

These directories are placeholders for future feature development. As the application grows, each feature will be implemented in its respective directory to maintain a clean, modular architecture.
